# things I want to cover
only things left are
- reading in json - making a request to an api (not sure if this should be 2 steps)
- using []bytes readers and buffers

# fixes to the site
- would be nice to have a tree structure diagram for files
- have a copy button in code segments
- have some way to differentiate between a code segment being a file and a command
